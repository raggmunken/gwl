<h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight">Data Processing Addendum</h1>
<p>This Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") forms part of the agreement between Genetic Wellness Labs ("Processor") and the user ("Controller") for the provision of genetic testing and analysis services. This DPA reflects the parties' agreement with regard to the processing of personal data by the Processor on behalf of the Controller in connection with the services provided.</p>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>1.1 "Personal Data"</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 "Processing"</strong> means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 "Controller"</strong> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 "Processor"</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller.</p>
</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>2. Processing of Personal Data</h2>
<p>2.1 The Processor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Controller, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the Processor is subject; in such a case, the Processor shall inform the Controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</p>
<p>2.2 The Processor shall ensure that persons authorized to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p>
<p>2.3 The Processor shall take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR (security of processing).</p>
<p>2.4 The Processor shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist the Controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR.</p>
<p>2.5 The Processor shall assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the Processor.</p>
<p>2.6 The Processor shall, at the choice of the Controller, delete or return all the Personal Data to the Controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data.</p>
<p>2.7 The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller.</p>
<p>2.8 With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the Processor shall immediately inform the Controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.</p>
</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>3. Sub-processing</h2>
<p>3.1 The Processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorization of the Controller. In the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes.</p>
<p>3.2 Where the Processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the Controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the Controller and the Processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the Processor shall remain fully liable to the Controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations.</p>
</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>4. Data Transfers</h2>
<p>4.1 The Processor shall not transfer Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) without the Controller's prior written consent and shall ensure that any such transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards as required by Chapter V of the GDPR.</p>
</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>5. Cooperation</h2>

</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>6. Term and Termination</h2>
<p>6.1 This DPA shall remain in effect for as long as the Processor carries out Personal Data processing activities on behalf of the Controller.</p>
<p>6.2 Upon termination of the agreement between the Controller and the Processor, the Processor shall comply with the obligations set out in Section 2.6 of this DPA.</p>
</section>
<section class="space-y-4">
<h2>7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>7.1 This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Processor is established. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this DPA shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction.</p>
